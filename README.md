# Project-bigB
This is a development log.

Bancor protocol had a good idea, bad execution. I lack the skill and experience to develop an AMM from scratch. I'll be buiilding and developing on the basis layed by Bancor.
It'll be slow. I'll learn by practising and understanding the Bancor V3 codebase.

### Main goals and changes:
- main *goal* is to simplify the code as much as possible, reduce overhead and make the protocol sustainable with the least possible long term intervention
- make the protocol as decentralized as possible non-reliant on admin

Changes:
- No whitelisting
- No Governance token
- No migration
- No liquidity protection
    - Instant withdrawals
    - No withdrawal fee
Main benefits:
- Protocol token backed with real token equity
- Surplus revenue shared with LPs
- Protocol token acts as a stablecoin following the ETH price
